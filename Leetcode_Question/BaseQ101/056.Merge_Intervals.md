## Question
> Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** intervals = `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
>> **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
>> **Explanation:** Since intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.
## Goal
- We're given a list of intervals, each represented as `[start, end]`. Our goal is to merge any overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by start time.
## Logic
1. sort the intervals
2. Two intervals A and B, 
	- If they overlap → **merge** them
	- If they do NOT overlap → append B to the result
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = [intervals[0]]
        for B in intervals[1:]:
            A = merged[-1]
            if A[1] < B[0]:
                merged.append(B)
            else:
                A[1] = max(A[1], B[1])
        
        return merged
```
