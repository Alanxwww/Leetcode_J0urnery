# 🧠 Leetcode_J0urnery

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving journey!  
This repository is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, written primarily in Python. It serves as a learning journal as I prepare for coding interviews and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting & Searching
- Heaps, Hashmaps, and more...

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each problem is organized by topic or difficulty (WIP). Inside each folder:
- Problem description (brief)
- Python solution with comments
- Time and space complexity analysis (when available)

## 🚀 Goal

Solve **300+ LeetCode problems** to build a solid foundation for technical interviews and algorithmic thinking.
